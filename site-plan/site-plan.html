                Purpose
            </h3>
            <!-- change the following -->
            <p>For over 40 years, White Water Rafting Company has relied on the satisfaction of our customers to drive in new and repeat business. And although that has worked well for us in the past, it's time to join the 21st century. Our purpose is to share information about our rafting packages, the services we offer, and the classes that we teach to a new generation of adventure seekers and to help them discover the exciting world of white water river rafting! We also want to create an online community for our clients that allows them to share with others their stories of rafting the rivers of the Great Northwest!</p>  

            <h3>
                Audience
            </h3>
            <!-- change the following -->
            <p>The target audience for our readership is anyone wanting to get out into the great outdoors and experience nature in person. Although we cater to river rafters, we really would like to provide a community for anyone who wants to get out and enjoy outdoor activities like camping, hiking, bird watching, and, yes, especially river rafting. We want a site that will allow these folks to gather and to invite their friends and families, and we would hope to inspire them to explore our rivers and wilderness areas with us. Another demographic would be to attract more professional rafters to our site by offering special deals and incentives to get them to come to our location.</p>  <!-- change this -->

                Wireframes

            <p>Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
                <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
                <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
                <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
                <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
                <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>
            </ol>
