            <p>The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.</p>

            <p>The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.</p>

                <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
                <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
                <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
                <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
                <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>
