# Temple Inn & Suites Website Plan
![](images/tias_logo.png)
## Site Purpose
The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain headquartered in Bethesda, MD that builds and manages specialized hotel accommodations near temple locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around the world. The owner-operated company caters to temple workers, patrons, and their families by providing specialized services and accommodations that meet the needs of those patrons. The hotel accommodations and services are available to anyone willing to abide by the terms and policies outlined by the company. __The overall goal of the website project is to promote and provide information about the specialized services that this hotel chain offers to meet the needs of temple patrons who come to serve in the temple or who participate in events such as sealings, weddings, receptions, and youth trips.__ The website should reflect the Church culture and be designed to support a temple oriented theme as well as the concept of being a haven of comfort and accessibility.
## Target Audience and Scenarios
This site is meant to help those who are travelling long distance to visit a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple, or are working at a temple for an extended period of time as a temple worker. 
We also provide other services such as wedding reception venues which may be of use to members of the LDS faith.
